#
# Purpose - Default System-wide Configuration File
#
# As this file is shipped, all default configuration options are commented 
# out. Configuration options without a default have a definition here. 
# All options also include a short explanation of purpose.
#
# Configuration option strings are case-INSENSITIVE.
#
# In general, this file is read ONCE by an application at initialization.
#
# Certain options accept a list, i.e., of integers or strings.
# These options allow list elements to be omitted, e.g.,
#
# DBF_EXTENT_SIZES = 1999, , 1999;
#
# If an option is defined more than once, the last definition is used.
#
# Unless the option name begins with "GEM_" or unless the comments state
# "Used by all executables",  the option is processed only by stone.
#
# For options which affect all database sessions but which are only processed
# by stone, the other executables will obtain the value of that option from
# stone via a TCP/IP connection to stone.
#

#=========================================================================
# CONFIG_WARNINGS_FATAL  
#  If TRUE then any warning about invalid or out of range entries
#  in a config file is treated as a fatal error terminating the
#  process (gem or stone) that is parsing config files.
#  The last occurrence of this config parameter in any config file parsed
#  will control the value used. If the last occurrence is TRUE,
#  then any warnings from parsing preceding config parameters will
#  be treated as fatal.
# Default: FALSE
#  CONFIG_WARNINGS_FATAL = FALSE;

# DBF_ALLOCATION_MODE:  Description of space allocation heuristic to be used
#  when filling DBF extents. 
#  Permissible values: either SEQUENTIAL, or a list of allocation weights,
#    separated by commas, each weight corresponding to each extent in the
#    series of extents specified in DBF_EXTENT_NAMES. 
#  A single value must be >= 5 and <= 200. If multiple values are used,
#  the total must be > 0 and each element must be >= 0 .
# Default: SEQUENTIAL
#DBF_ALLOCATION_MODE = SEQUENTIAL;

#=========================================================================
# DBF_EXTENT_NAMES:  List of all DBF extents, in order, primary extent first,
#  separated by commas.
# Default: NONE -- stone will not run without an extent list defined.
# A value for this option is provided at the end of this file.
# On Linux, CIFS filesystems are not allowed for extents.

#=========================================================================
# DBF_EXTENT_SIZES: List of maximum sizes of all DBF extents, in order, 
#  primary extent first, separated by commas, each size applies to  the
#  corresponding extent in the list of extents specified in DBF_EXTENT_NAMES.
#
#  For optimal performance using a raw Unix disk partition, this setting
#  should be at least 16 MB smaller than the actual size of the partition.
#
#  Note: The actual maximum size of an extent will always be a multiple of
#        16 MB. If an extent size specified by DBF_EXTENT_SIZES is not a
#        multiple of 16 MB, then the actual maximum size will be the next
#        **lowest** multiple of 16 MB. For example, an extent created with
#        a maximum size of 260 MB, this extent really has a maximum size
#        of only 256 MB.
#
#  Elements of the list may be blank to specify maximum sizes for some
#  but not all extents, such as:
# DBF_EXTENT_SIZES = 2048MB, , 2048MB;
#
# Default units: M Bytes (1 Megabyte = 1048576 bytes), suffixes KB, MB, GB

# DBF_PRE_GROW:  Pre-grow DBF extent sizes.
#
# When this is set to TRUE and there are extents for which a size is set 
# in DBF_EXTENT_SIZES, each extent with a size in DBF_EXTENT_SIZES will be 
# pregrown to that size.
# 
# The value of DBF_PRE_GROW may also be a list of integer sizes. Extents with 
# an integer size specified in DBF_PRE_GROW will be pregrown to this size if 
# needed. It is an error if a (non-blank) DBF_PRE_GROW size is larger than 
# a (non-blank) value for an extent in DBF_EXTENT_SIZES. Extents without an 
# entry in DBF_PRE_GROW will not be pregrown .

# GEM_FREE_FRAME_CACHE_SIZE
#
#  Determines the size of the gem's free frame cache. When using the

#  frame cache is full.
#
#  A value of 0 disables the free frame cache (the gem acquires frames one
#  at a time). A value of -1 means use the default value. The default is
#  0 for caches less than 100 MB and 10 for caches of 100 MB or greater
#  size.

#  a free frame rather than use one from the free frame list (to allow
#  the Stone process to use the remaining free frames). 
#
#  If the value of the parameter is -1, the free frame limit is set to a

#
#   This option has no effect local gems (i.e., gems running on the same

# SHR_PAGE_CACHE_LARGE_MEMORY_PAGE_POLICY
#
# Specifies whether large memory pages will be used when creating the
# shared page cache. Enabling large memory pages can result in
# significant performance gains when large shared page caches are used.
# The improvement is due to a reduction in translation lookaside buffer
# (TLB) cache misses. The TLB is an internal structure used by the
# operating system to manage memory address translation.
#
# Large memory page support is an operating system and hardware dependent
# feature. Currently, GemStone supports large memory pages on AIX and 
# Linux only. This configuration option is silently ignored on all other
# platforms.
#
# 3 policies are available on supported operating systems:
#
# 0 - Disabled:  No large memory page support.
#
# 1 - Advisory:  Large memory pages are requested when the shared page 
#                cache is created. If the operating system denies the 
#                request, a warning is printed in the SPC monitor log
#                file and the cache is started without large memory 
#                pages. NOT RECOMMENDED ON AIX!
#
# 2 - Mandatory: Large memory pages are requested when the shared page 
#                cache is created. If the operating system denies the 
#                request, an error is printed in the SPC monitor log
#                file and the shared page cache fails to start.
#
# Both Linux and AIX require operating system kernel changes in order to
# enable large memory pages. Refer to the largememorypages utility and
# the Installation Guide for more information.

# Default: 0  Min: 0  Max: 2
#SHR_PAGE_CACHE_LARGE_MEMORY_PAGE_POLICY = 0;

#=========================================================================
# SHR_PAGE_CACHE_LARGE_MEMORY_PAGE_SIZE_MB
#
# Specifies the large memory page size in megabytes used when creating the
# shared page cache. 
#
# Currently this option is only supported on Linux and AIX, and is ignored on 
# all other platforms; also ignored if SHR_PAGE_CACHE_LARGE_MEMORY_PAGE_POLICY
# is set to 0.

# Valid large page sizes on Linux are 2 MB and 1024 MB. Not all processors 
# support one or both large memory page sizes. A value of 0 means GemStone 
# will determine the default large page size to use based on system info.
# The default is determined by looking at:
#   /sys/kernel/mm/hugepages/hugepages-1048576kB/nr_hugepages 
#   /sys/kernel/mm/hugepages/hugepages-2048kB/nr_hugepages
#   the value of Hugepagesize in /proc/meminfo
# If there are 1GB pages configured, the value defaults to 1GB; otherwise, if 
# there are 2MB pages configured, the value defaults to 2MB; otherwise, the
# Linux default in /proc/meminfo is used.
#
# AIX supports only 16 MB large pages.

# SHR_PAGE_CACHE_LOCKED : Specifies whether the shared page cache should
#   locked (frozen) in (main) memory. This is a performance related option.
#   On machines that need to swap out memory, but where a portion of memory 
#   can be dedicated to GemStone, this option will provide higher performance
#   for GemStone. Increasing system memory is recommended.
#
#   In order for this option to take effect, the user may require special
#   operating system dependent privileges. If the user does not have
#   the privileges, an error message will be logged and the system will
#   continue.
#
# Default: FALSE
#SHR_PAGE_CACHE_LOCKED = FALSE;

#=========================================================================
# SHR_PAGE_CACHE_NUM_PROCS
#
#   Maximum number of sessions allowed to attach to the shared cache. 
#   This parameter is used to allocate space in the shared page cache 
#   for session information and cache statistics.
#   This cache space is in addition to page space allocated by
#   SHR_PAGE_CACHE_SIZE_KB. This value must accommodate the GcGems and 
#   various background GS processes, as well as user gem/topaz session 
#   processes. Using too small a value will result in sessions being 
#   unable to login because they can't attach to the cache, while too 
#   large a value will result in wasted space in the cache.
#
# Default: -1  
#   The default setting causes the system to calculate a reasonable value 
#   for this parameter.
#   For stone's cache
#           STN_MAX_SESSIONS (for user sessions)
#           + 5 (for stone, pcmon, pagemanager, symbolgem and admingcgem)
#           + STN_MAX_GC_RECLAIM_SESSIONS + 1 (for reclaimgcgems)
#           + SHR_NUM_FREE_FRAME_SERVERS (for free frame threads )
#           + STN_NUM_LOCAL_AIO_SERVERS  (for AIO threads )
#           + 1 logsender
#           + 1 (to allow stopstone to login)
#           + 1 statmonitor
#
#   For a remote cache startup triggered by GciLogin 
#        STN_MAX_SESSIONS + 3(pcmon, free frame thread, statmonitor)
#
#   For a remote cache started with startnetdi -E (for GciX509Login) ,
#   The config file specified by -E should contain SHR_PAGE_CACHE_NUM_PROCS .
#   The default on Linux is half of smaller of maximum open files or
#   maximum size of a semaphore array. On other platforms the default is 256.
#
#   While this value should be adequate for most cases, it may still yield
#   session login failures under special cases, such as:
#    * first-time startup of a system that needs to create new extents
#    * adding extents dynamically using SystemRepository>>createExtent:
#
#   Also, this value assumes that ALL sessions in the system will be 
#   attaching to this cache. If your architecture uses remote gem servers 
#   with their own remote caches, you should specify a value for 
#   SHR_PAGE_CACHE_NUM_PROCS using the above calculation but only allocating 
#   space for those sessions running on the local/remote host. For example:
#
#   On stone machine:
#
#           Maximum number of user sessions running on stone machine
#           + 5 (for stone, pcmon, pagemanager, symbolgem, and admingcgem) 
#           + STN_NUM_GC_RECLAIM_SESSIONS (for reclaimgcgems)
#           + SHR_NUM_FREE_FRAME_SERVERS (for free frame threads)
#           + STN_NUM_LOCAL_AIO_SERVERS  (for AIO threads)
#
#   On remote machine:
#
#           Maximum number of user sessions running on remote machine
#           + 2 (for pcmon, pgsvr)
#           + SHR_NUM_FREE_FRAME_SERVERS (for free frame threads)
#
#  
# Minimum:  number of extents (for startup page servers)
#           + 5 (for stone, pcmon, pagemanager, symbolgem and admingcgem)
#           + STN_NUM_GC_RECLAIM_SESSIONS (for reclaimgcgems)
#           + SHR_NUM_FREE_FRAME_SERVERS (for free frame threads)
#           + STN_NUM_LOCAL_AIO_SERVERS (for AIO threads )
#
#   While sufficient for starting the stone, the minimum may not
#   allow additional user or GcGem sessions to attach to the cache,
#   regardless of the setting of STN_MAX_SESSIONS.
#
# Maximum:  STN_MAX_SESSIONS
#           + 5 (for stone, pcmon, pagemanager, symbolgem and admingcgem)
#           + 3 (for hotStandby gem, stopStone gem, and one extra)
#           + 256 (maximum possible value for STN_NUM_GC_RECLAIM_SESSIONS)
#           + 30  (maximum possible value for SHR_NUM_FREE_FRAME_SERVERS)
#           + 256 (maximum possible value for STN_NUM_LOCAL_AIO_SERVERS)
#           + (-n value of STN_CACHE_WARMER_ARGS)

# STN_EXTENT_IO_FLAGS
#
#  Specifies what (if any) special I/O flags will be used to open the 
#  database extents. Two kinds of special I/O are supported: direct I/O
#  and concurrent I/O.
#
#  Direct I/O tells the operating system avoid caching extent data in the
#  file system cache. Enabling direct I/O tells the operating system to 
#  treats the database extents as if they were on raw partitions. Direct 
#  I/O may greatly improve database performance in some cases.
#
#  Concurrent I/O is only available to extents running on the Enhanced JFS
#  file system (aka JFS2) on AIX. Setting this flag has no effect on other
#  operating systems.
#
#  If the requested I/O mode is not available, the stone will fail to start
#  and an error message will be printed in the stone log. If this happens,
#  change this option back to zero and restart the stone.
